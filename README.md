Radmin
====

Radmin is a system for automatic early detection of application-level DoS attacks. Radmin actively monitors the resource consumption of target programs, and uses a timed probabilistic finite automata (PFA) model to detect, early in time, if the program is consuming resources out of the norm. It is also capable of detecting if the program is starving or stalling (e.g., due to livelocks).
